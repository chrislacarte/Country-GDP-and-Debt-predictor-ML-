Given limited comparability of these series on account of differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the average CPI inflation for 2014-16 and end-of-period inflation for 2015-16 are not reported in the World Economic Outlook. Inflation projections reflect the upper bound of the program range given recent world commodity price developments. Harmonized prices: No Base year: FY2013/14.

Latest actual data: 2020 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special - special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;.

Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border.
